# Multithreaded-unique-word-counter
Uses OpenMP to create multiple threads and create a key-value pair of word-to-occurrences in a text file.

This is an old file that I've written a few years ago; I am refactoring this code to make it more readable and efficient.
It currently does not work properly; threads take longer to create than to solve the problem without it.
